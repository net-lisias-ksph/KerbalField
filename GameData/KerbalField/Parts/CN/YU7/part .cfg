description = Fish - 7 anti-submarine torpedo MK46 (beauty) introduction, in the mid - 1990 - China's fake Mk - 46 Mod type 1 torpedo in the United States. It was built by all the Chinese ships and equipment. Fish - 7 light anti-submarine torpedo is China to the United States Mk 46 Mod - 1 (2) Block for reverse engineering. Torpedo by xi 'an precision machinery research institute (705, a China shipbuilding industry corporation subordinate units) and northwestern polytechnical university (NPU) development, and production by 872 and 872. Yu - 7 was developed by all of the PLA navy its surface ships equipped as standard anti-submarine warfare (ASW) mission system.
