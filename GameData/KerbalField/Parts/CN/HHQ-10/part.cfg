description = Red flag - 10 / FL - 3000 n ship self defense missile weapon system, developed by China aerospace science and industry group company, which can effectively intercept the various types of anti-ship missile, dealing with land, air and sea for saturation attack by ship. Red flag - 10 for self-use model, FL - 3000 n for export model.
