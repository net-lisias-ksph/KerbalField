description = Thunderbolt 12 (foreign trade type SD - 10) is developed by China from a new generation of air-to-air missile, the horizon attack under the radar seeker. PL - 12 using normal aerodynamic layout, total length of 3850 mm and 203 mm in diameter, 674 mm wingspan, weighs 160 kilograms, maximum launch distance of 70 km, the maximum speed of Mach 4 maximum overload 38 g, operational height 25 km, with omnidirectional attack ability and good under shooting ability. In 2004, finalize the design before targeting trials, Pi 12 made 12 of 12 good grades. Thunderbolt 12 at the end of 2005 in double target trial order together, created the air-to-air missile in our country and a new milestone in the history development.
