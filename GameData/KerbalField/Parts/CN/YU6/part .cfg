description = Fish - 6 is a 533 mm heavy torpedo, is also China's first USES the modular design and open software architecture design of the torpedo, which powered by liquid fuel, the guidance system USES Intel microprocessor 80486 - class, can use wire guidance, the passive acoustic conductance or wake to a variety of ways, such as guidance, the "race to" is a more advanced way of guidance, to and through the ship (hidden) boat race, the rudder turning at a certain Angle, so that toward the boat ship, this way of seeker makes the torpedo would like snakes, about to catch up with the ship.
