description = With the improvement of tank armor protection technology and the emergence of active protective armor, adopts hollow charge warhead anti-tank missile attack efficiency to the limit. In order to be able to effectively combat are equipped with these armored tanks, China's latest generation of anti-tank missile arises at the historic moment, it is a compelling "red arrows" - 10 anti-tank missile weapon system, its successful development shows that China has been able to independent research and development of weapon systems with the international leading level. "Red arrows" - 10 anti-tank missile weapon system is mainly used for attack within 100 meters to 5000 meters distance of the enemy tanks and other armored targets, when necessary, can also be used to attack the enemy reinforced concrete fortification and shelters. Its mission is to provide anti tank army, division troops fighting the backbone of the fire; With other anti-tank soldiers.
