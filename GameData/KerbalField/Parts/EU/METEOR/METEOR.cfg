	description = The "meteor" air to air missile is a new generation of air - to - air missile powered by an air breathing engine. The missile uses seeker and two-way data link technology of active homing radar, the engine gas flow regulating ratio is greater than 10, with a wide flight envelope. Through the analysis on the performance of the bomb, it can determine the overall combat performance of meteor "will exceed the world service of various types of medium range air-to-air missile.
